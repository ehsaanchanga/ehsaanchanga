Hi 👋 My name is Vivian Guillen
I'm a Frontend Developer with a passion for CSS & JS
I've been learning to code for 10 years now, time flies! It feels like just yesterday when I wrote my first line of JavaScript. I fell head over heels for it and even today, I'm as comfortable with it as ever. These days, I'm diving into Laravel, setting my sights on becoming a full-stack developer. My goal? To be able to code a SaaS all by myself!

⭐ After freelancing for the last 5 years I'm ready for a change and I'm now looking for a full-time job. I'm mainly a Vue girl but can also work with React, and have some experience with Laravel. I'm also a huge Tailwind CSS fan (so much that I run Tailwind Weekly) and love working with it too.

If you or anybody you know is looking for a seasoned frontend developer who is also eager to learn backend then let's chat 😁
